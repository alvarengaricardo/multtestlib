## Example

**Code:**

    import multtestlib  
    def main():
    
    a = 90  
    b = 35  
    c = 12
    
    with multtestlib.Pool() as pool:
	    pool.starmap(multtestlib.test_equal,
		[(a, 90),
		 (b, 35),
		 (c, 12)])
    		 
    if __name__ == "__main__":  
        multtestlib.init()  
        multtestlib.freeze_support()  
        main()  
        multtestlib.end()

**Output:**

    test_equal - a: 35 b: 35 Result: Pass
    test_equal - a: 90 b: 90 Result: Pass
    test_equal - a: 12 b: 12 Result: Pass
    Total: 3
    Passed: 3
